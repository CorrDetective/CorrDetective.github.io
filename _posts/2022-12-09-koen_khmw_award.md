Another award for Koen Minartz! This time, the CD researcher received the first prize for Computer Science in [KHMW Young Talent Awards](https://khmw.nl/wp-content/uploads/Juryrapport-KNVI-KIVI-Scriptieprijzen-voor-Informatica-en-Informatiekunde-2022.pdf) for his thesis on Correlation Detective. These prizes are awarded annually to promote scientific education in engineering and science subjects. They are incentives for students who not only produce very high quality scholarly work, but also produce work that enables them to develop new insights and translate their findings into practice.

In his thesis, Koen worked on scalable detection of complex similarities in big (static) data which contributed to the paper [Multivariate Correlations Discovery in Static and Streaming data](https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p1266-papapetrou.pdf) (VLDB 2022).

This award is a well deserved recognition for his hard work on the project, leading to a honourable graduation and a paper at a prestigious conference.
We are very proud to have as part of the team.
Go Koen!

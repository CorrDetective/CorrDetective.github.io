Big Announcement! **We are taking part in [STELAR](https://stelar-project.eu/)**, an EU funded project aimed at creating a Knowledge Lake Management Systems (KLMS) for the Agri-Food sector. The project is a collaboration between the Athena research institute, the University of Athens, The Universität der Bundeswehr München (UBM), Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), and various industry partners from the agri-food space.

As part of the work package *Data Interlinking and Alignment*, Correlation Detective will be implemented as an operator in the [RapidMiner](https://rapidminer.com/) software, in order to provide multivariate similarity statistics between datasets.

We are very excited to bring our algorithm into production, and hope that this project marks the start of many fruitful collaborations.
Let's put CD in the toolbox of the modern day Data Analist!

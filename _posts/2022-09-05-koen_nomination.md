Koen Minartz, lead researcher and inventor of the original CD static algorithm, has been nominated for the **TU/e Best Overall Master Thesis** awards for his work on Correlation Detective. In his thesis, Koen worked on scalable detection of complex similarities in big (static) data which contributed to the paper [Multivariate Correlations Discovery in Static and Streaming data](https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p1266-papapetrou.pdf) (VLDB 2022).

The TU/e Academic Awards is an annual event where Eindhoven University of Technology celebrates students and researchers who produced the best thesis, in four different categories: Bachelor, Master, EngD, and PhD. For each category, one student/researcher is nominated from each department. Winners are chosen by an independent multidisciplinary panel of professors. The list of candidates can be found [here](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/calendar-and-events/academic-events/tue-academic-awards/tue-msc-academic-award-nominees/)

This nomination alone is a well deserved recognition for his hard work on the project, leading to a honourable graduation and a paper at a prestigious conference.
We are obviously cheering for him to win. 
Go Koen!

*Koen is currently working as a PhD student at the TU/e Data Mining group under the supervision of Vlado Menkovski.*
*Although Koen is still affiliated with the Correlation Detective project, he is currently focusing on simulation of biological systems with Machine Learning techniques.*

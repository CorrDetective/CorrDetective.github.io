We are happy to announce that Correlation Detective is now available as a Java Library on [GitHub](https://github.com/CorrelationDetective/library) and [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.correlationdetective/CorrelationDetective/overview).

This is a major milestone for the project, as it enables researchers and practitioners to easily use Correlation Detective in their own projects.
The library includes all the newest features as described in our [VLDBJ 2023 article](https://www.win.tue.nl/~opapapetrou/papers/CD_differentmeasures.pdf), including:
1. Support for **six popular correlation measures**:
    1. Pearson's correlation
    2. Spearman's correlation
    3. Euclidean similarity
    4. Manhattan similarity
    5. Total correlation
    6. Multipoles
2. **top-k**, **threshold** and **progressive** queries.
3. Support for **additional constraints** on the correlation patterns.
4. Optimized search space **routing**.

Documentation on how to use the library (including all the parameters) can be found on the [GitHub](https://github.com/CorrelationDetective/library).

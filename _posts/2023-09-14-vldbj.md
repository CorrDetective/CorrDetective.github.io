We are happy to announce that our article [*Efficient detection of multivariate correlations with different correlation measures*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00778-023-00815-y?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20231011&utm_content=10.1007/s00778-023-00815-y) has been accepted for publication in the VLDB Journal. 

This article is an extended version of our VLDB 2022 paper, and includes the following:
1. An extension of the static algorithm to support **two new correlation measures**: Total Correlation and Euclidean Similarity.
2. A redesign of CDStream's streaming model, enabling faster detection of concept drift and **improved recall**.
3. Introduction of a new routing principle for traversing the search space, causing a **2x speedup** for top-k queries.
4. A new **experimental evaluation** of the algorithms, with more datasets, queries, and a comparison with state-of-the-art DBMS.

The article is available [here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00778-023-00815-y?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20231011&utm_content=10.1007/s00778-023-00815-y).

In 2022 there are 17 Graduation Awards, for exceptional achievements (master thesis/research report), for students who graduate in the academic year 2021/2022 at a Dutch institution of academic education. 

In his thesis, Koen worked on scalable detection of complex similarities in big (static) data which resulted in the paper [Multivariate Correlations Discovery in Static and Streaming data](https://vldb.org/pvldb/vol15/p1266-papapetrou.pdf) (VLDB 2022).

This nomination alone is a well deserved recognition for his hard work on the project, leading to a honourable graduation and a paper at a prestigious conference.
We are obviously cheering for him to win. 
Go Koen!
